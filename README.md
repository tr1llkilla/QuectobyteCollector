The first program ever written to record data in quectobyte data units, Useful for upgrading the entire programming world.

The **QuectoVirtualMemoryCollector (QVMC)** is a research-grade telemetry and simulation framework designed to model virtual memory behavior at the sub-byte scale—specifically, the quectobyte (10⁻³⁰ bytes). This system enables entropy-aware, volatility-sensitive, and compression-optimized memory modeling in virtualized environments.

This project is part of Cadell Anderson's pioneering research into post-byte computing and sub-byte information theory.

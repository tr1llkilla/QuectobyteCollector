Anderson, C. R. (2025). QuectoVirtualMemoryCollector: A Sub-Byte Telemetry Framework for Virtualized Memory Systems. Published manuscript.

This is the first program ever written to record data in quectobyte data units. Useful for upgrading the entire programming world.

The **QuectoVirtualMemoryCollector (QVMC)** is a research-grade telemetry and simulation framework designed to model virtual memory behavior at the sub-byte scale‚Äîspecifically, the quectobyte (10‚Åª¬≥‚Å∞ bytes). This system enables entropy-aware, volatility-sensitive, and compression-optimized memory modeling in virtualized environments.

This project is part of Cadell Anderson's pioneering research into post-byte computing and sub-byte information theory.
